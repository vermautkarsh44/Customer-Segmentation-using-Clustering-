# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering-

Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task. It involves automatically discovering natural grouping in data. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.

Here, we are segregating the customers according to their annual income and shopping habits for businesses to target them accordingly, resulting in increased sales.

Here, we have data of 200 customers of a mall. We have segregated them into 5 categories:
  1) Careful
  2) Standard
  3) Target
  4) Careless
  5) Sensible
  
We have performed 2 types of Clustering here:

   a) K-means Clustering
  
   b) Hierarical Clustering(Agglomerative method)
