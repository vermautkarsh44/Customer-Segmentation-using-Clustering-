# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering-

To segregate the customers according to their annual income and shopping habits for businesses to target them accordingly resulting in increased sales.

Here, we have data of 200 customers of a mall. We have segregated them into 5 categories:
  1) Careful
  2) Standard
  3) Target
  4) Careless
  5) Sensible
  
We have performed 2 types of Clustering here:
  a) K-means Clustering
  b) Hierarical Clustering(Agglomerative method)
